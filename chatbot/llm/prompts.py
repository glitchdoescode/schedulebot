class PROMPT_TEMPLATES:

    GENERATE_MESSAGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """ 
Generate a conversational response to coordinate an interview meeting schedule, using the provided details to facilitate effective communication between the participant and a contact at the interviewer‚Äôs company. The response should be polite, concise, friendly, and aligned with the current conversation state, with system guidance considered if provided. Format the message as a WhatsApp-ready message that can be sent directly without any edits, using friendly language and emojis to enhance the conversational feel.

**Multilingual Handling**: 
- Ensure the response is in the same language as the user's message (**{user_message}**).
- If the user's message contains multiple languages, respond in the language that forms the primary part of the message or aligns most naturally with the context of scheduling.

Additionally, if the scheduling process encounters issues, note that **{role_to_contact_name}** is not the person the interview is scheduled with but rather a designated contact responsible for manual assistance with scheduling. This individual will handle any conflicts or issues raised by **attention flags** and should be informed if no automatic scheduling solution is found.

In addition, identify any queries related to interview scheduling, including availability, rescheduling, meeting details, or cancellations, by referring to the conversation history of both the participant and the other participant. Address these queries in a way that feels seamless and informative, based on the conversation's stage.

2. Use Conversation State - "{conversation_state}" to shape the response according to the conversation‚Äôs stage, especially in handling availability, rescheduling, or cancellations.
3. Address Other Participant's Conversation History - "{other_participant_conversation_history}" appropriately if it's not NULL or empty, based on the participant‚Äôs role:

    DETECT_INTENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
**Multilingual Handling**:
- While analyzing the conversation history and user message, consider the language of the messages to ensure contextual understanding.
- **Output the identified Current Intent in English** in the specified format, regardless of the input language.

**Input Variables**:
- **Participant Name**: {participant_name}
- **Participant Role**: {participant_role}
- **Meeting Duration**: {meeting_duration}
- **Role to Contact**: {role_to_contact} (designated contact for manual scheduling assistance if needed)

- **Previous Intent**: {conversation_state} (last known intent from previous interactions)
- **User Message**: {user_message} (latest message from the participant, which may impact the current intent)

### Task

1. **Analyze**: Review the conversation history and user message to understand the interaction flow and any actions taken by either the participant or chatbot.

2. **Identify Intent**: Based on the conversation history and user message, identify the most accurate current intent from the following options:

    **Intents**:

    - **CANCELLATION_REQUESTED**: The participant has requested to cancel the meeting.
      - Example: User: "Can we cancel the meeting on Tuesday?"

    - **QUERY**: The participant asks a specific question or makes a request unrelated to scheduling or seeks clarification about scheduling details.
      - Example 1: User: "What time is the meeting tomorrow?"
      - Example 2: User: "Which Saturday are you referring to?"

    - **RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED**: The participant wants to reschedule the meeting but has not yet suggested new timing or confirmed availability. **This intent applies only if the participant explicitly asks to reschedule**.
      - Example: User: "Can we reschedule the meeting?"

    - **SLOT_ADD_REQUESTED**: The participant requests to add a new available time slot for scheduling interviews.
      - Example: User: "I'd like to add Wednesday afternoon as an available slot."

    - **SLOT_REMOVE_REQUESTED**: The participant requests to remove an existing available time slot.
      - Example: User: "Please remove the slot on Friday morning."

    - **SLOT_UPDATE_REQUESTED**: The participant requests to update the details of an existing available time slot.
      - Example: User: "Can we change the Thursday slot from 2 PM to 3 PM?"

    - **MEETING_DURATION_CHANGE_REQUESTED**: The participant requests to change the duration of the meetings.
      - Example: User: "Let's change the interview duration from 30 minutes to 45 minutes."

    - **NONE**: This intent is used if the message does not fall under "CANCELLATION_REQUESTED," "QUERY," "RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED," "SLOT_ADD_REQUESTED," "SLOT_REMOVE_REQUESTED," "SLOT_UPDATE_REQUESTED," or "MEETING_DURATION_CHANGE_REQUESTED," indicating the conversation is in a regular, undefined state.
      - Example: User: "I‚Äôm available for the meeting next Tuesday." | Chatbot: "Thanks! I‚Äôll confirm the time shortly."

3. **Participant Role Rules**:
    - If the **Participant Role** is "Interviewer":
        - They can provide their availability for rescheduling, add, remove, or update available slots, and change meeting durations.
        - If the message reflects any of these actions explicitly, classify accordingly.
        - If the message reflects availability without explicit requests to reschedule or modify slots, classify the intent as **NONE**.
    - If the **Participant Role** is "Interviewee":
        - They do not provide availability for rescheduling or modify slots.
        - If the message reflects a decline of a proposed time without an explicit request to reschedule, classify the intent as **NONE**.

4. **Important Notes**:
    - **User Message has more priority over conversation history.**
    - **Explicit Requests Take Precedence**: Only classify intents like **CANCELLATION_REQUESTED**, **RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED**, **SLOT_ADD_REQUESTED**, **SLOT_REMOVE_REQUESTED**, **SLOT_UPDATE_REQUESTED**, and **MEETING_DURATION_CHANGE_REQUESTED** if the participant explicitly makes such requests.
    - **Handling Queries**: If the user message is a query (e.g., "which Saturday?"), classify it as **QUERY**; otherwise, classify it as **NONE**.
    - **CANCELLATION_REQUESTED**: Classify only if the participant explicitly requests cancellation.
    - **RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED**: Classify only if the participant explicitly requests to reschedule.
    - **SLOT_ADD_REQUESTED**, **SLOT_REMOVE_REQUESTED**, **SLOT_UPDATE_REQUESTED**: Classify only if the participant explicitly requests to add, remove, or update slots.
    - **MEETING_DURATION_CHANGE_REQUESTED**: Classify only if the participant explicitly requests to change the meeting duration.
    - Use **NONE** when there are no queries, cancellation requests, explicit reschedule requests, or slot modifications, reflecting a neutral or ongoing conversation state.

5. **Output Format**:
   - Output only the identified **Current Intent** in this format:

   **Current Intent**: [Determined_Intent]
