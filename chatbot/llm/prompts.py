class PROMPT_TEMPLATES:

    GENERATE_MESSAGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """ 
Generate a conversational response to coordinate an interview meeting schedule, using the provided details to facilitate effective communication between the participant and a contact at the interviewer‚Äôs company. The response should be polite, concise, friendly, and aligned with the current conversation state, with system guidance considered if provided. Format the message as a WhatsApp-ready message that can be sent directly without any edits, using friendly language and emojis to enhance the conversational feel.

**Multilingual Handling**: 
- Ensure the response is in the same language as the user's message (**{user_message}**).
- If the user's message contains multiple languages, respond in the language that forms the primary part of the message or aligns most naturally with the context of scheduling.

Additionally, if the scheduling process encounters issues, note that **{role_to_contact_name}** is not the person the interview is scheduled with but rather a designated contact responsible for manual assistance with scheduling. This individual will handle any conflicts or issues raised by **attention flags** and should be informed if no automatic scheduling solution is found.

In addition, identify any queries related to interview scheduling, including availability, rescheduling, meeting details, or cancellations, by referring to the conversation history of both the participant and the other participant. Address these queries in a way that feels seamless and informative, based on the conversation's stage.

**Details for Response Generation**:
- **Participant Name**: {participant_name}
- **Participant Role**: {participant_role}
- **Participant Number**: {participant_number}
- **Participant Email**: {participant_email}
- **Role to Contact Name**(the designated contact who assists with manual scheduling in case of conflicts or issues): {role_to_contact_name} 
- **Role to Contact Number**: {role_to_contact_number}
- **Role to Contact Email**: {role_to_contact_email}
- **Company Details**: 
   {company_details}
- **Meeting Duration**: {meeting_duration} minutes
- **Superior Flag**: {superior_flag}
- **Conversation State**: {conversation_state}
- **Conversation History**(history of messages with the participant): 
   ```
   {conversation_history} 
   ```
- **User‚Äôs Message**(if not present, then generate response accordingly): {user_message} 
- **System Message**(if present, directs response towards desired outcome): {system_message} 

**Response Requirements**:
1. If there are any queries in User's message then address those queries first and then get back to scheduling based on the current Conversation State and Conversation History.
2. Use Conversation State to shape the response according to the conversation‚Äôs stage, especially in handling availability, rescheduling, or cancellations.
3. Include Sysemt's Message if present, to guide the response to the intended goal.
4. Ensure clarity, brevity (10‚Äì35 words max), and courtesy, particularly in states requiring additional attention or when involving a superior contact.
5. **If no suitable time slots are available**, note that **{role_to_contact_name}** should be contacted manually to help resolve the scheduling conflict.
6. Use a **friendly tone with emojis** to make the message approachable and personable.
7. **Generate the response in the language of user_message,** maintaining the same friendly and professional tone.
8. Ensure the response is formatted as a single, WhatsApp-ready message that can be sent directly without any modifications.
9. Explicitly adhere to the word limit of 10‚Äì35 words for the response, ensuring it remains concise but effective.

**Additional Instructions**:
- **Never ask for interviewee's availability unless explicitly mentioned in the system_message.**
- If the system message does not ask for the interviewee's availability, do not ask for their availability. Only proceed with confirming, rescheduling, or handling any issues related to the scheduling.

**Multilingual Handling**:
- While analyzing the conversation history and user message, consider the language of the messages to ensure contextual understanding.
- **Output the identified Current Intent in English** in the specified format, regardless of the input language.

**Input Variables**:
- **Participant Name**: {participant_name}
- **Participant Role**: {participant_role}
- **Meeting Duration**: {meeting_duration}
- **Role to Contact**: {role_to_contact} (designated contact for manual scheduling assistance if needed)
- **Conversation History**: {conversation_history} (all previous messages exchanged with the participant)
- **Previous Intent**: {conversation_state} (last known intent from previous interactions)
- **User Message**: {user_message} (latest message from the participant, which may impact the current intent)

### Task

1. **Analyze**: Review the conversation history and user message to understand the interaction flow and any actions taken by either the participant or chatbot.

2. **Identify Intent**: Based on the conversation history and user message, identify the most accurate current intent from the following options:

    **Intents**:

    - **CANCELLATION_REQUESTED**: The participant has requested to cancel the meeting.
      - Example: User: "Can we cancel the meeting on Tuesday?"

    - **QUERY**: The participant asks a specific question or makes a request unrelated to scheduling or seeks clarification about scheduling details.
      - Example 1: User: "What time is the meeting tomorrow?"
      - Example 2: User: "Which Saturday are you referring to?"

    - **RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED**: The participant wants to reschedule the meeting but has not yet suggested new timing or confirmed availability. **This intent applies only if the participant explicitly asks to reschedule**.
      - Example: User: "Can we reschedule the meeting?"

    - **NONE**: This intent is used if the message does not fall under "CANCELLATION_REQUESTED," "QUERY," or "RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED," indicating the conversation is in a regular, undefined state.
      - Example: User: "I‚Äôm available for the meeting next Tuesday." | Chatbot: "Thanks! I‚Äôll confirm the time shortly."

3. **Participant Role Rules**:
    - If the **Participant Role** is "Interviewer":
        - They can provide their availability for rescheduling.
        - If the message reflects this without explicitly requesting a reschedule, classify the intent as **NONE**.
    - If the **Participant Role** is "Interviewee":
        - They do not provide availability for rescheduling.
        - If the message reflects a decline of a proposed time without an explicit request to reschedule, classify the intent as **NONE**.

4. **Important Notes**:
    - User Message has more priority over conversation history.
    - If the user message is a query (e.g., "which Saturday?"), classify it as **QUERY**; otherwise, classify it as **NONE**.
    - **CANCELLATION_REQUESTED** should be classified only if the participant explicitly requests cancellation.
    - **RESCHEDULE_REQUESTED** should be classified only if the participant explicitly requests to reschedule. Declining a proposed time without further mention of rescheduling should not trigger this intent.
    - Use **NONE** when there are no queries, cancellation requests, or explicit reschedule requests, reflecting a neutral or ongoing conversation state.

5. **Output Format**:
   - Output only the identified **Current Intent** in this format:

   **Current Intent**: [Determined_Intent]

**Example Output**:
